You are given seven hexagon tiles.  Each tile has 6 colored segments.

Colored segments can be any color from the following, Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Orange, Purple.  Colors may also repeat on the same hexagon tile.  The tiles themselves are also labeled 1 - 7.

You need to place the 7 hexagon tiles on a board such that the first hexagon is placed in the center, and the remaining 6 are placed going around the first.  The trick is that adjacent segments of the hexagons must have the same color in order for the placement to be valid.  Your program must use recursion to find a possible solution.
